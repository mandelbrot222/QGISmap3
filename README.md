# QGISmap3

This project displays a Leaflet map with shapes from `spaces.geojson`. The geometry is fixed and served by a small Node.js server.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the map.
